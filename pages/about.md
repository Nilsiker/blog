## ðŸ¦€ Hi, I am Andreas.

**I code game systems in Rust.**

When I don't do that I work as a fullstack developer in MalmÃ¶, Sweden. 

In this blog, I write about [the programming language Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and my projects and ideas on game systems development using the [Bevy game engine](bevyengine.org/).

*Stick around for a post! Maybe you can teach me something in the comments.*

## ðŸ’¼ Are you a recruiter? 

You are probably looking for my [portfolio page](https://nilsiker.github.io/). 

But be warned, it has a lot fewer rants about Rust, gaming, tabletop RPGs.
